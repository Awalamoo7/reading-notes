### Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is a state of mind needed to overcome challenges and learn. It involves seeing challenges as opportunity to learn and develop rather than being discouraged by it. 

**How to stay in a growth mindset**

2. See every setback or challenges as an opportunity to learn.
3. Be inspired by the success of others.
